This my Learnig project to employ the html, css and javascript(jquery) together to use the keyboard clicks and the onsite clicks for playing a simple game.
The simon game goes as :
1.Press any key on keyboard to start
2.Now there will be a button which will animate and make a noise 
3.we have to click at the colour which was animated or enhanced
4.Now there will be another button which will enhance now we have to click in the order from to last
and then keep going like this
Example.The player pressed a key to start the game and the green color button got animated then the palyer has to click at the Green colour button
Then the red clour button got animated then the player has to click at the button in the order green->red button if in wrong order pressed then it will lead to restart of the game 
if in correct order pressed then a new button will get animated let say blue then the player should click in the order green->red->blue and so on.
